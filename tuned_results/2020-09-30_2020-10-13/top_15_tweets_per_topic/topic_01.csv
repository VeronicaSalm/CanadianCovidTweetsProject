Is this a 2020 version of bone spurs? Is Trump faking COVID to avoid narcissistic injury of losing the election?"
1314661161183391746,0.01603,7,Donald Trump is the biggest spreader of disinformation (and covid). If twitter isn‚Äôt going to make changes to his account around the election then their changes will only make things worse by silencing those that will be sharing facts.

All I know ‚Äî it‚Äôs impossible to believe people who constantly lie."

This is why I try not to live in ""what if"" rabbit holes. I've learned that we usually worry about the wrong stuff. Life has a way of throwing surprises.

1312371193945755649,0.01552,12,I don‚Äôt feel bad that Trump got COVID. The way he was dressed he was asking for it. It‚Äôs God‚Äôs will. He‚Äôs just lying about getting COVID for fame. He isn‚Äôt COVID‚Äôs type. COVID never even met him. He should make the best out of a bad situation and be forced to have COVID‚Äôs baby.

Trump got COVID because he's dumb. He'll try to spin it because he's a liar.

Believing he's capable of an elaborate conspiracy gives him power. It's implying he's playing 4D chess when he doesn't know how to set up a checkerboard."
