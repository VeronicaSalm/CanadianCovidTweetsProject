1360989943183544326,0.02194,140,"Even though I tried to ignore Twitter this week but what I still learnt on the Twitter this week anyway:

1. While NFLD's government responds to a severe COVID outbreak with ninja-like pandemic management skills, Ontario's Premier promotes Tim Horton's new real egg sammich."

Has anyone else noticed that the Ford Government suddenly has ""data glitches"" every time they are making a major announcement?

The media needs to look into whether Elliott &amp; Ford are INTENTIONALLY manipulating the data to put artificially low stats with their headlines. https://t.co/teBqaxcSq2"
1361361499944583169,0.01837,34,"Still don't understand why they call it 'The Ontario Strategic Pandemic Response Framework.'

I mean wouldn't it be a lot easier just to say 'Doug Ford's Re-election Campaign Donor List'?"

Msg me at nyousif@thestar.ca!"
1358859260759793666,0.0183,10,"First CBC wrote an ""article"" about Tim Hortons Dark Roast.

Now the Premier is giving them a shout-out during a Covid-19 press conference, talking about the international franchise as though it's a Mom &amp; Pop Shop.

Someone please hire the Timmies PR team to help sell vaccines."
1359934731232698376,0.01798,35,"As we wait for the announcement of March Break being delayed, I can’t help but remember when Ford told Ontarians to “go away and have a good time” for the 2020 March Break. Things were not off to a great start with this pandemic in Ontario and it’s been a mess ever since. #onpoli"
1361050561018277897,0.01791,56,Hang on. Doug Ford went to meet a 100-year-old for her birthday? The same Doug Ford who locks down restaurants &amp; schools &amp; churches? The one who makes cringe videos telling you to stay home? But he can visit a high-risk person for a photo op? What a disgraceful cheater he is. https://t.co/2xvvF5do56
1359566049318903813,0.01785,20,The fact that you're making any kind of funding announcement for public transit before we've had a chance to look at post-COVID demand as people start working more from home is absolutely idiotic and I've come to expect nothing less from you people. https://t.co/OKnKGYGNRD
1361135863959183360,0.01772,7,"This long weekend, a reminder that pandemic productivity is an unnecessary expectation to substantiate. All those people you know writing books, starting businesses, refurbishing their homes - good for them. Only thing you actually have to do is not get COVID-19. You're welcome."
1359511218734706691,0.0177,35,"I’m tired of it. In fact, I kind of wish our provincial leaders would issue a moratorium on COVID-19 pressers and release a blanket statement in their absence, to the effect of “We have no f---ing clue what is going on, @EmmaRoseTeitel writes.

It was way after we all knew and it wasn't something they were keeping tight, it was for our security

1361699560884736001,0.01731,72,Serious question: why has Premier @fordnation (and therefore his staff) been traveling so much during Ontario’s #StayAtHome order &amp; pseudo-lockdown? His Twitter alone shows the endless events &amp; incessant photo ops he’s taken over the last few weeks. #onpoli
1358864059534356480,0.01721,1,"Someone please make what Doug Ford said make sense! What I understand is that we are still in ‘lockdown’ but some stores can open but not restaurants, and schools can open but not salons... Also, I want a Tim Hortons brkfst sandwich now #onpoli https://t.co/Z38jUCfK02"
1357655472304771078,0.01721,1,"@flammtap @NomadicBruce That being said, I miss Toronto...the Toronto I knew before Covid. I'm sad to think that Toronto won't ever return. The city is different, downtown I hardly recognized when we left, many amazing small shops gone along the Danforth. I'm surprised more hasn't been written about it"
