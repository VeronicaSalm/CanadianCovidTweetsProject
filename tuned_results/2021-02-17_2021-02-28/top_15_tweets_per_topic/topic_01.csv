This week he tested positive for COVID and is in isolation. He's trying real hard to remain upbeat but it's not easy.

1364741468460511233,0.02117,1,@acabforbooty Certain businesses have been closed for months. That's a dorm of lockdown enough to use the word. Oh and this topic has nothing to do with race. Sad that needs to be said. You really got to stop only seeing skin color when you look at or talk about people. You sound kinda racist

Trying to figure out *how* happy or sad or angry or cautious to feel can be overwhelming. 

The government saying it's okay to cry isn't particularly helpful. 

But we've gotta find ways of getting through."
1364201975592722440,0.02092,16,#LongCovid is not an afterthought. It‚Äôs not a subheading. It‚Äôs THE story. Between 1 in 10 and 1 in 3 people who get covid don‚Äôt recover for months (yes- even not knowing the exact figure is quite telling). It really blows my mind how this is still considered a marginal issue.
1364357405430198274,0.02086,1,@DrBarbKing Absolutely agree! My point is that we have so many folks who are vocal about the fact that small businesses are in trouble and point fingers at govt as the sole reason we are in lockdown. Yes govt should do better but so should every person who was in line to buy a throw pillow.

Govts controlling citizens

Psychologists manipulating people

Doctors advocating harmful solutions

Journalists not asking questions
