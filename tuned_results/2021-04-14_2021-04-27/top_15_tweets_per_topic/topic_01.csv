- Scientists are only human and they're doing the best they can with limited data.

- When the facts change, we need to change our minds.

- In a pandemic, it's not a bad idea to err on the side of assuming the worst.

1384274723631079428,0.02165,36,Expert in statistics here.  It's mathematically impossible for linear vaccination growth to control exponential pandemic growth.  Ford is gaslighting you with fundamental misunderstandings of math.  Vaccines do not a pandemic control strategy make.  No matter their rate. https://t.co/79kU80jxNI
1383609398380040194,0.02154,8,so i told my thesis advisor that the pandemic is making it hard to focus on work and they told me i should quit academia if my work doesn't bring me solace in hard times. that's the kind of support rich tenured faculty are offering right now.

So way worse scenario compared with trials but vaccines *still* highly protective. https://t.co/iRKkq4TLdE"

but 
our context is that a lot of people are apparently at pretty high COVID19 risk based on Canadian transmission numbers. https://t.co/tplilGWjTd"
1384366552326234122,0.02014,1,"@mekki Curious, can you elaborate?  Linear f(x) can outpace exponential f(x) if x-values are small, so context matters.  Also this presumes the ""pandemic"" function is monotonically increasing, which shouldn't be the case the closer we get to herd immunity with vaccinations."

why do you keep trying to gaslight ontario with your fundamental misunderstandings of math.

This is an experimental gene therapy which should not be given in such a cavalier way."

I don't think some realize just how fragile life is right now. We are facing human crisis because of what we did. I don't understand why do this? https://t.co/JK3j4Y7F69
