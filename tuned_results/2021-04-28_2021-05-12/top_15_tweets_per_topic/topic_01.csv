Betting we reach herd immunity slightly ahead of our US cousins and well ahead of when most think it will occur .July  1 +4th are going to be epic https://t.co/6nNYfWxAAO

This thread is for you. I hope it re-affirms your smart decision to get protected from COVID asap &amp; empowers you to know the signs of VITT."
1392478455258771456,0.02518,1,It hit me on a gut level a week or so ago that I'm never quite going to be the person I was a year and a half ago. Maybe if the pandemic had lasted for a month I would have just reverted afterwards. But that's not where I'm at. I've changed. Permanently.

It was me dealing with how angry I am at the anti-maskers/vaxxers and Covid downplayers.
I just pulled the video.

NO OTHER COUNTRY anywhere in the world recommends a 4 month dose gap.

So PLEASE: don't consider yourself protected until you get two doses. https://t.co/i7BSwTRdL5"

I'm more inclined to a let's see approach ... after the dust settles."
