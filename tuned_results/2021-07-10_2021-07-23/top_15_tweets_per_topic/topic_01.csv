1. Natural immunity is not superior to vaccine immunity 
2. Young people are being hospitalized and suffering long haul COVID19 leading to grey matter brain ðŸ§  degeneration
3. Vaccines are not against nature, diseases wipe out the unvaccinated https://t.co/bu76cmuniu"

Headache, Runny nose, my body hurts, coughing, feeling hot &amp; no itâ€™s not allergies 

Itâ€™s called a breakthrough infection, glad Iâ€™m vaccinated but this is not good at all ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¬"
1414285294208094208,0.03285,7,Now seems like the perfect time to remind people that being vaccinated does NOT mean that you have a magical force field against Covid around you. If you are exposed you can still catch it. You will likely experience a milder form of illness but you can still get sick.

I guess you don't realize that it's a multi-system disease and a lot of people are having problems after infection even if they didn't know they got infected in the first place.
1415153570152919042,0.03161,1,@MonicaGandhi9 Troubling to see this conclusion drawn. Those with severe infection are more likely to have end organ damage so more likely to have persistent symptoms. There's a very clear long covid syndrome that can develop in those with mild initial illness.
1415835991529689088,0.03159,1,"Good thread looking at Covid infections in vaccinated people. Whether or not vaccines reduce severity, it is obvious they donâ€™t stop infection or transmission. Therefore, herd immunity by vaccination is a fallacy and pursuing vaccine passports is nonsensical. https://t.co/PgiwPj49MX"
1414995280986927105,0.03149,6,"DEBATE!
The natural consequence of not getting vaccinated is risk of getting COVID. It should not be having your freedom limited.
Agree? Disagree?

P.S. Double-vaxxed with AZ myself.  I'm pro-choice on vaxx, glad most folks got them, wary of clamping down on those who didn't."

@DannyReeves33 I sincerely hope you survive, and then I hope you use this experience to encourage the people who trust and listen to your voice to get vaccinated. https://t.co/gqXjkjSSJg"

1415917948460490754,0.0299,1,"@bucketwoman0 @Hrendel_lok @angie_rasmussen As asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic spread happens in covid, it stands to reason that vaxxed people with breakthrough asymptomatic or low symptom cases can spread covid, even though the viral load will be much lower."
1415927349422575618,0.0291,1,"I can't think of a better definition for a pyrrhic victory than trying to attain herd immunity in a pandemic by getting as many people as possible infected as quickly as possible.

How is this still a matter of discussion?"
1418256014428672005,0.02907,6,"I don't understand where the vaccine has gone haywire

Why are vaccinated people afraid of the unvaccinated ?

 For the 100 years that we've had vaccinations they are designed to keep people from getting sick or spreading the disease

The Covid one does not???"

""Maybe there's just an ebb &amp; flow to life where something's supposed to wipe out a certain amt of people &amp; that's just kind of the way evolution goes. Vaccines kind of stand in the way of that.""

1415871632871202822,0.02879,1,@Manny70944327 Good question. Because if all it takes is one person to test positive - who is by the way fully vaccinated - to affect an entire group of people then this vaxx experiment is for the birds.  https://t.co/SKWuEZZmfq
